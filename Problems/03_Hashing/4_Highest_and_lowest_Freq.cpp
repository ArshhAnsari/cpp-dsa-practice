/*
Purpose of INT_MIN and INT_MAX:

INT_MIN: This represents the smallest possible integer value (a very large negative number). 
We use it to initialize maxFreq because we want to find the maximum frequency. 
Any real frequency from the array will be larger than INT_MIN, so it helps us start the comparison.

INT_MAX: This is the largest possible integer value. 
We initialize minFreq to this because we are looking for the smallest frequency. 
Any actual frequency will be smaller than INT_MAX, making it useful for finding the minimum.

How It Works:
maxFreq starts at INT_MIN: This means we're setting the lowest possible value, so that any frequency we find will be higher and can replace it.
minFreq starts at INT_MAX: We're setting the highest possible value, so any actual frequency will be smaller and replace it.

Key Variables:
maxElem: Stores the element that appears the most times in the array.
minElem: Stores the element that appears the least times in the array.

Example Walkthrough:
For the array {10, 5, 10, 15, 10, 5}, hereâ€™s what happens:

Count the frequency of each element:

10 appears 3 times.
5 appears 2 times.
15 appears 1 time.

Tracking maximum frequency (maxFreq):
maxFreq starts at INT_MIN. As we count the elements, we see that 10 appears 3 times, which is greater than INT_MIN, 
so we update maxFreq to 3 and set maxElem to 10.

Tracking minimum frequency (minFreq):
minFreq starts at INT_MAX. As we count the elements, we find that 15 appears 1 time, which is less than INT_MAX, so we update minFreq to 1 and set minElem to 15.

Final Output:
maxElem = 10 (because 10 appears the most with 3 occurrences).
minElem = 15 (because 15 appears the least with 1 occurrence).

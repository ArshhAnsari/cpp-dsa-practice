/* This is the most efficient of the three. 
- It first eliminates all even numbers (except 2) in a single step, which is very fast.
- Like the second function, its loop only goes up to sqrt(num).
- Crucially, it skips all even numbers in its loop by using i += 2. This means it performs roughly half the number of iterations as the second function.*/

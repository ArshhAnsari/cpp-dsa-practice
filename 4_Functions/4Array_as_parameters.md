Let's break down what `*(arr + i)` means step by step:

1. **Pointer to the First Element:**  
   When you have an array (or a pointer to its first element), say:
   ```cpp
   int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
   ```
   the name `arr` acts as a pointer to the first element, equivalent to `&arr[0]`.

2. **Pointer Arithmetic:**  
   In C++, when you add an integer `i` to a pointer, like `arr + i`, you're moving the pointer forward by `i` elements. The compiler takes into account the size of the data type.  
   - For example, `arr + 2` points to the element at index `2` (i.e., `arr[2]`).

3. **Dereferencing:**  
   The dereference operator `*` is used to access the value at the memory location pointed to by the pointer.  
   - So, `*(arr + i)` accesses the value stored at the address `arr + i`.

4. **Equivalent to Array Indexing:**  
   This operation is equivalent to writing `arr[i]`. Both expressions fetch the element at the index `i` of the array.

### **Example**

Consider this simple code snippet:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    // Using array indexing
    cout << "Using array indexing: " << arr[2] << endl; // prints 30

    // Using pointer arithmetic and dereferencing
    cout << "Using pointer arithmetic: " << *(arr + 2) << endl; // also prints 30

    return 0;
}
```

- `arr[2]` directly gives the element at index 2, which is `30`.
- `*(arr + 2)` first moves the pointer `arr` two positions ahead (to `arr[2]`), then dereferences that pointer to get the value `30`.

### **Summary**

- **`arr`**: Points to the first element of the array.
- **`arr + i`**: Moves the pointer `i` elements forward.
- **`*(arr + i)`**: Dereferences the pointer to access the value at that new location.  
- This is the exact same as writing `arr[i]`.

I hope this clarifies the concept of `*(arr + i)` for you!

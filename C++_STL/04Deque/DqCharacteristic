std::deque Characteristics:
Dynamic Nature:

std::deque is dynamic in the sense that it can grow and shrink as needed. It does this by managing its internal memory structure dynamically, allowing efficient insertions and deletions at both the front and back.
Combination of Vectors and Lists:

Conceptually, std::deque combines the advantages of both std::vector and std::list:
From std::vector: It inherits the ability for random access with constant-time complexity (O(1)), allowing you to access elements quickly using an index.
From std::list: It inherits the ability to efficiently insert and remove elements at both ends, unlike std::vector, which is only efficient at the back.
Implementation Using Static Arrays:

Internally, std::deque is typically implemented using multiple static arrays (or blocks). These arrays are of fixed size, but they are dynamically allocated and managed by the deque.
The deque maintains a control structure (like a list of pointers) that points to these static arrays. When elements are added or removed, the deque adjusts this control structure to manage its storage efficiently.
Key Points to Remember:
Dynamic Growth: Despite using static arrays internally, std::deque behaves dynamically. It can allocate new static arrays as needed and link them into the overall structure. This makes it flexible and adaptable, much like std::vector or std::list.

Efficient Operations: std::deque provides efficient operations at both ends (front and back) and fast random access, combining the strengths of both std::vector and std::list.

Memory Management: The use of multiple static arrays allows std::deque to avoid the overhead of frequent reallocations or shifting of elements, which can happen in std::vector. This leads to better performance, especially when frequently inserting or deleting elements at both ends.

Conclusion:
std::deque is indeed dynamic in its behavior and usage, though it internally relies on multiple static arrays to achieve this flexibility.
It offers a versatile solution that balances the strengths of both std::vector (fast access) and std::list (efficient insertion/removal), making it a powerful container in C++.

Key Takeaway:
std::deque does not have a capacity() function because its internal memory management is based on multiple blocks, not a single contiguous memory area. It dynamically manages these blocks without needing to track or report a "capacity" as std::vector does.
